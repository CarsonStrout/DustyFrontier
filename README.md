# Dusty Frontier
A 2D western platformer project that further developed my game development experience through better levels, mechanics, player movement, and enemy control.

# What I Learned
* Further understanding of Unity functions (ie Line Renderer, Trail Renderer, Animations, Enemy AI)
* Create patrolling enemies that attack the player within a certain range and "vision cone"
* Better control of the camera through cinemachine and scripts
